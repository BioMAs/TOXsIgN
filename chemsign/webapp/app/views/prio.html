<h2>ChemPSy - Prioritization tool (under construction)</h2>

<div class="well">
    <p>The prediction tools are based on the ChemSPY project developed within the IRSET institut.
    <br /><br />
    The aim of ChemPSy (Chemical Prioritization System) is to provide an innovative tool based on several bioinformatics and biostatistics methodologies to analyze and integrate massive toxicogenomics datasets. Specific objectives include: (1) classification of chemicals based on transcriptional signatures, i.e. the set of genes whose expression is known to be positively or negatively altered after an exposure to these compounds; (2) the association of classes with human pathologies or deleterious phenotypes, i.e. classes containing toxicants with well-known effects; (3) the prediction of novel reprotoxicants and/or endocrine disruptors based on transcriptional signature similarities with known chemicals affecting testis development and function.</p>
