<h2><i class="fa fa-plus"></i>        Making public</h2>
<p>By default, each submitted project and its related signatures are tagged with a “private” status meaning that only authorized users (the owner but also coauthors) can access the uploaded data. At this stage, information can still be modified simply by uploading an updated version of the Excel template. A button is available on the web interface for each project to request the TOXsIgN administrators to change the project status from private to public. If “warnings” are still detected, this demand is rejected. The administrators will then help the investigators make the necessary modifications to change the status. Full instructions and examples of the submission procedure are provided in the <a href="#/tutorial">tutorial</a> section.</p>
