<h2><i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i>        TOXsIgN organization overview</h2>
<p>The TOXsIgN repository is organized in a four-layer architecture (Project > Study > Assay > Signature) associated with a unique identifier. The project layer covers one or several studies addressing specific questions.
  Each study in turn is associated with at least one assay that assesses the exposure of a given study model (e.g., cell culture, living animal, human population) to at least one chemical (e.g., pesticide, plasticizer, drug, or endocrine disruptor),
  physical (e.g., type of radiation or temperature) or biological (e.g., pathogen or parasite) agent at a given dose and for a given time of exposure. This organization makes TOXsIgN compatible with mixtures and transgenerational studies.
  A toxicogenomic signature is defined as the description of the “omic” (e.g. epigenomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic) effects on individuals or their descendants of exposure to single or combined environmental agents.</p>
