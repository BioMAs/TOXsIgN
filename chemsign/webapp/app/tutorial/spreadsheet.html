<h2><i class="fa fa-plus"></i>        How to fill the TOXsIgN spreadsheet</h2>
<p>The TOXsIgN spreadsheet is divided into 6 sheets. Each sheet describes, respectively, only one project and at least one study, assay, factor and signature. The last one describe all ontologies used in TOXsIgN. This template will be improved over time to respond fully to users' expectations. <b>So please, only use its the latest version.</b></p>

</div>
<h5>Project</h5>
<p>The project is a high level concept that links related studies, assays, factors and signatures. A project is described and linked using the following fields:
  <ul>    
    <li><i>Project Id : </i>Project identifier for the spreadsheet. <b>Do not modify it.</b></li>
    <li><i>Title : </i>Provide a unique title that describes the overall project. You should make titles as descriptive as possible.</li>
    <li><i>Description</i>: Provide a thorough description of the goals and objectives of this project. The abstract from the associated publication may be suitable. Multiple summary lines can be included.</li>
    <li><i>PubMed link(s)</i>: [Optional] Specify a valid PubMed identifier (PMID) that references a published article describing this study. Most commonly, this information is not available at the time of submission - it can be added later once the data are published.</li>
    <li><i>Crosslink(s)</i>: [Optional] Specify a Web link that directs users to supplementary information about the study. Please restrict to Web sites that you know are stable.</li>
  </ul>

<h5>Studies</h5>
<p>In TOXsIgN you can choose between an interventional or an observational study:<br>
    <b>An interventional study is defined as</b>: A study in which participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. The assignments are determined by the study protocol. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions.<br>
    <b>An observational study is defined as</b>: A biomedical or behavioral research study of human subjects designed to assess risk factors for disease development or progression, assess natural history of risk factors or disease, identify variations based on geographic or personal characteristics (such as race/ethnicity or gender), track temporal trends, or describe patterns of clinical care and treatment in absence of specific study-mandated interventions.<br><br>
    Each line describe a study and each study is defined and linked using the following fields:
  <ul> 
      <li><i>Study Id : </i>Study identifier for the spreadsheet. <b>Do not modify it.</b></li>

<h5>Assays</h5>
<p>An assay is in general an experiment that converts either a material or data sample, into a new material or data sample, via a protocol. Multiple assays can be connected to a Study.
Each line describe an assay and each assay is defined and linked using the following fields:
  <ul> 
      <li><i>Assay Id : </i>Assay identifier for the spreadsheet. <b>Do not modify it.</b></li>
      <li><i>Associated study : </i>Study identifier for the spreadsheet associated with this assay.</li>

<h5>Factors</h5>
<p>A fator describes the exposure of a given study model (e.g. cell culture, living animals, human population) to at least one chemical (e.g. pesticides, plasticizers, drugs, endocrine disruptors), physical (e.g. radiations, temperature) or biological (e.g. pathogens, parasites) factor at a given dose and at a given time of exposure. This organization therefore makes TOXsIgN compatible with mixtures studies. Currently, factors are restricted to chemical compounds. <br>
Each line describe one factor and each factor is defined and linked using the following fields:

  <ul> 
      <li><i>Factor Id : </i>Factor identifier for the spreadsheet. <b>Do not modify it.</b></li>
      <li><i>Associated assay : </i>Assay identifier for the spreadsheet associated to this factor.</li>

<h5>Signatures</h5>
<p>TOXsIgN allow scientists to actively submit toxicological signatures, defined as the description of physiological, cellular, molecular or omic effects on individuals or their descendants, after exposure to single or combined environmental factors. You can create either physiological, molecular or genomic signature.<br>
      <b>Physiological signature</b>: physiological responses (i.e. disease, pathway or biological process alteration) after an exposure to single or combined environmental factors.<br>
      <b>Molecular signature</b>: molecular responses after an exposure to single or combined environmental factors.<br>
