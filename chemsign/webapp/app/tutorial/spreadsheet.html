<p>During the submission procedure, investigators should record all required information in a dedicated Excel template. <a href="#/download">This document</a> is divided into six sheets dedicated to:
  i) the description of one project; ii) of at least one study; iii) of at least one assay; iv) of at least one experimental factor; v) of at least one signature; finally, vi) the last sheet describes all ontologies used in TOXsIgN.
This template is frequently updated. <b>You should always make sure that you are using the latest version</b>.

<h5>Studies</h5>
<p>One study addresses specific questions and is associated with at least one assay. There are two types of study: interventional and observational studies.
An interventional study is defined as: A study in which participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. The assignments are determined by the study protocol. Participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions.
An observational study is defined as: A biomedical or behavioral research study of human subjects designed to assess risk factors for disease development or progression, assess natural history of risk factors or disease, identify variations based on geographic or personal characteristics (such as race/ethnicity or gender), track temporal trends, or describe patterns of clinical care and treatment in absence of specific study-mandated interventions.

Each line in the corresponding sheet describes one study that is described using the following information:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A unique study ID (TSS prefix): Please do not modify it.</li>

<h5>Assays</h5>
<p>The assay assesses the exposure of a given model (e.g., cell culture, living animal, organ explant, human population) to at least one factor at a given dose and for a given time of exposure.<br>

An assay is in general an experiment that converts either a material or data sample, into a new material or data sample, via a protocol. Multiple assays can be connected to a study.
Each line describes an assay and each assay is described using the following information:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A unique Assay ID (“TST” prefix): Please do not modify it.</li>
  <li>Associated study: Please indicate the Study identifier (TSS) associated to this assay.</li>
  <li>A title: Please provide a unique title describing the assay</li>
  <li>Organism: [Optional & use ontologies] Please indicate the organism from which the biological material was derived (pleas use the controlled vocabularies).</li>
  <li>Sex: [Optional] Please indicate the gender.</li>
  <li>Developmental stage: [Optional] Please indicate the developmental stage.</li>
  <li>Tissue: [Optional & use ontologies] Please indicate the tissue from which the biological material was derived.</li>

  <li>Cell line: [Optional & use ontologies] Please indicate the cell-line used.</li>
  <li>Experimental type: [Optional] Please indicate the experimental type (in vivo, ex vivo, in vitro...).</li>
  <li>Population age: [Optional & only for observational study].</li>
  <li>Geographical location: [Optional & only for observational study].</li>

<h5>Factors</h5>
<p>An experimental factor describes at least one chemical (e.g. pesticides, plasticizers, drugs, endocrine disruptors), physical (e.g. radiations, temperature) or biological (e.g. pathogens, parasites) factor at a given dose and at a given time of exposure. This organization makes TOXsIgN compatible with mixture studies. Factors are currently restricted to chemical compounds.
Each line describes one factor and each factor is described using the following information:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A unique Factor ID: Please do not modify it.</li>
  <li>Associated assay: Please indicate the Assay identifier (TST prefix) associated with this experimental factor.</li>
  <li>Exposition factor: Please indicate the type of factor (biological, physical or chemical). Currently TOXsIgN is restricted to chemical factor.</li>

<h5>Signatures</h5>
<p>A toxicological signature is defined as the description of physiological, cellular, molecular or omic effects on individuals or their descendants, after exposure to single or combined environmental factors. You can create either physiological, molecular or genomic signatures.<br>
Physiological signature: physiological responses (i.e. disease, pathway or biological process alteration) after an exposure to single or combined environmental factors.<br>
Molecular signature: molecular responses after an exposure to single or combined environmental factors.<br>
Genomic signature: set of genes whose expression is known to be positively or negatively altered after an exposure to single or combined environmental factors.
